# IAA-short-design-events-public

 This project is set up to provide an example script for extracting RAOs from a wave only white noise case and a wind only case (turbine parked) and to produce combined wave and wind short design events.
 My MATLAB isn't very efficient and the script for creating short design events doesn't use many functions so this is uploaded as an example of how the events can be produced rather than as a ready to use script.
